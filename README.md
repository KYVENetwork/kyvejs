Tools for building applications on KYVE.

KYVE, the Web3 data lake solution, is a protocol that enables data providers to standardize, validate, and permanently store blockchain data streams. By leveraging permanent data storage solutions like Arweave, KYVEâ€™s Cosmos SDK chain creates permanent backups and ensures the scalability, immutability, and availability of these resources over time.

## Project Overview

Common:

- [@kyvejs/types](common/types/README.md) - holds all types for the KYVE application in typescript
- [@kyvejs/sdk](common/sdk/README.md) - development kit for communicating with the KYVE blockchain
- [@kyvejs/protocol](common/protocol/README.md) - core functionality for running protocol nodes on the KYVE network

Integrations:

- TODO: implement
