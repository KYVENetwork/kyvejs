<strong>Tools for building applications on KYVE.</strong>
</p>

KYVE, the Web3 data lake solution, is a protocol that enables data providers to standardize, validate, and permanently store blockchain data streams. By leveraging permanent data storage solutions like Arweave, KYVEâ€™s Cosmos SDK chain creates permanent backups and ensures the scalability, immutability, and availability of these resources over time.
